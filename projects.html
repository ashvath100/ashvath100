            <h2 class="title">Legged Robot Support For Ardupilot</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The idea behind this project was to make a opensource platform for walking robots,where <br> 
                anyone with an ardupilot flight contoller and basic know how can build a complex system <br>
                like a quadruped.<br>
                The support was implemented via the new scripting engine in ardupiot.With the added <br>
                support for PyBullet users can also modify a few parameters and add their custom frames<br>
                simulate and test the physics.<br>

            <h2 class="title">Automated Guided Vehicle</h2>
            <p class="text">
                During my time at Srinar Robotics at Chennai I worked on upgrading the existed frame work <br>
                which was being used to run the AGV by shifting the higher level control to ROS , spent my<br>
                time here experimenting on variaous mapping and SLAM methods.

            <h2 class="title">Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)</h2>
            <p class="text">
                One of the most challenging projects I have worked on ,the AUV is capable of completing tasks <br>
                autonomously with no theather or controller.The system was build over the ArduSub code base from<br>
                Ardupilot with an on board computer and cameras used for navigation.
